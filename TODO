# TODO

*aka a dev's backlog*

*aka **T**his **o**ughttabe **d**one, **o**r ...*

- ```coffee``` is obviously no fitting name :-(

- check for validity of input (yaml.load() eg. returns a long string for non-yaml files)
document supposed input file structure

  ```[DONE]``` sanit-check implemented, testing alignment of issues and FSM

- refactor cli-prompt code (that has become quite ugly)

  ```[DONE]``` probably still needs work to actually be (unit)testable

- re-write in PHP :-)
- or, just a thought, how about prolog ? querying big datasets could be interesting.

- test ```coffee.CLI``` (so far there's just a very basic smoke test instantiating a ```CLI``` object)
