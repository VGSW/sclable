The easiest way to run coffee is  to build using the Makefile. `make build` will
bild a  Docker image  and `make  run` will  run an  one-off container  from this
image.

Doing it all in one step:

    make clean test build run

Alternatively the command line interface can be executed directly too:

    python -m coffee.cli

Data must  be given in YAML  files with 'transitions' and  'issues' as top-level
keys which can be given in separate files  or combined in a single file. See the
supplied .yml files  for examples (the examples are also  included in the Docker
image).
